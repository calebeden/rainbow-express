# Rainbow Express
## Description
This project is a web-based application designed to track attendance at Mission Arlington's Rainbow Express program. It was created out of a desire to alleviate some of administrative burden caused by the pen-and-paper nature of much of the Mission's daily activities. By moving this one aspect to a digital format, I hope that it saves the effort of having to track down the physical attendance sheets each day and can instead provide an instantaneous method of communicating this data. I hope that it can also be developed further to provide deeper data analysis, or even inspire other aspects of the organization to transition to a digital format. In the end, I hope this digital transition will allow Mission Arlington to spend more time directly helping those in need in the local community, rather than spend it manually completing and filing paperwork.
